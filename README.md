# Polynomial Interpolation Graphical Demonstration

## Authors: Joshua Fawcett, Hans Prieto

This program was created as the final submission to the Math 351 Course Project. It provides
a simple graphical interface that allows users to plot points in a cartesian plane while the 
program automatically computes and displays the interpolation polynomial (using Newton's
algorithm for calculating the interpolating polynomial). 

This demo was implemented in Python 3.7.0 using pygame 2.0.1

To start the program, simply run Main.py
